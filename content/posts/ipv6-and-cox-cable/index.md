## Context
As I have studied for various IT networking certifications, I am often told about how important IPv6 is going to be.  I can distinctly remember the many hours spent preparing myself for when I would face it in the real world.

However, after about three full years in the IT industry, mostly in networking, I have yet to encounter it in the wild.  In an attempt to keep my skills sharp, and to play with something different, I am going to attempt to run a dual-stack at my homelab.

## What is IPv6

## Setting it up at home
Right now my WAN connection is a FortiGate 70F connecting to Cox Cable through a cable modem.

I have also previously played with an OpnSense VM in the same configuration, and will probably eventually move back to that after my trial run of FortiGate ends.

Based on some research about Cox's implementation of IPv6, they typically offer a fairly robust service.  People have reported getting subnets as large as /56, though that hasn't been my experience.

## My results

## Thoughts and experiences
Running IPv6 in a dual-stack is an extremely flexible chance to play with
