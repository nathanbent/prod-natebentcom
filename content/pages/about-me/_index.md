## About me, quickly
My name is Nate Bent, and I am a Network Engineer who is lucky enough to be able to work with a variety of technologies in some complex, public facing environments.  If I had to summarize myself quickly:

- I spend my days working on designing, implementing and maintaining wired and wireless networks that are used by tens of thousands of people. 

- I spend my nights playing with and learning new technologies that interest me, to name a few:
  
  - Virtualization and containerization
  
  - Automation, specifically network automation (for obvious reasons)
  
  - AI and ML predictive modeling

**The latest generalized version of my resume is available in [.pdf](https://files.natebent.com/CVs/Resume.pdf) and [.docx](https://files.natebent.com/CVs/Resume.docx) formats.**
